    %h2 Leveling System
    %p Break away from traditional grading where students are afraid to attempt assignments that may be challenging at first. Leveling systems are completely customizable and allow you to help your students focus less on letter grades and more on their learning experience. Teaching a course on astronomy? Why not have levels named for each of the planets? GradeCraft levels allow you to be creative to give your students the best experience possible.
